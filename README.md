## What does it do?

KALESP is a mining development platform using ESP32 that implements hash algorithms (Keccak-256) and enables serial communication with a Python interface. Currently, the project already has:

- [x] Rust firmware for ESP32
- [x] Python GUI for control and monitoring
- [x] Bidirectional serial communication between ESP32 and Python
- [x] Difficulty and entropy configuration for mining
- [x] Real-time hashrate and status monitoring
- [x] ESP32 executes Keccak-256 mining equivalent to existing miners
- [ ] Python orchestrates plant ‚Üí work ‚Üí harvest
- [ ] Integrate Python to Transactions submitted via Launchtube successfully

## How does it work?

The project uses a distributed architecture:

1. **ESP32 (Rust Firmware)**: Executes hash algorithms (Keccak-256) and processes commands via UART
2. **Python Interface**: Provides a modern GUI with Flet, manages serial communication and displays real-time metrics
3. **Serial Communication**: Structured message protocol for command and data exchange between ESP32 and host

The system allows configuring parameters like difficulty (prefixed zeros) and entropy, executing the mining process directly on the ESP32.

## Why is it relevant?

This project is relevant because:

- It demonstrates the feasibility of mining on low-power devices like ESP32
- Serves as a foundation for integration with the KALE blockchain ecosystem on the Stellar network
- Enables experimentation with hash algorithms and proof-of-work on embedded hardware
- Offers an educational platform for understanding mining and blockchain
- Explores the potential of IoT devices as distributed mining nodes

## What else needs to be built?

Yes, for complete integration with kale-farmer and real KALE mining, we still need:

- Integration with Stellar SDK via Python host
- Automatic orchestration of plant ‚Üí work ‚Üí harvest cycle
- Real-time block monitoring
- Automatic proof-of-work submission to blockchain
- Rewards and stakes management
- Implementation of security features (private keys, secure communication)
- Testing in Testnet environment and Mainnet deployment
- Performance optimization to achieve ~100 KH/s
